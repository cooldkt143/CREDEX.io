# CREDEX.io:- Measure What You Can Build

## Overview

CREDEX is a proof first credibility platform that measures real skills based on what a person has actually built and solved, not what they claim on resumes or profiles.

Instead of relying on self declared skills, CREDEX analyzes real work across platforms like GitHub, competitive programming sites, and hackathon portals to generate a transparent credibility score and a clear improvement roadmap.

The goal is simple.
Make skills measurable, verifiable, and actionable.

## Problem Statement

Today, skills are easy to claim but hard to verify.Real work is scattered across multiple platforms such as:
- GitHub
- HackerRank
- GFG / LeetCode
- Unstop
- Behance, Medium, Kaggle (for creators)

Because of this:
- Recruiters struggle to judge actual ability
- Students do not know what to improve next
- Resumes focus more on wording than real proof
- Most tools optimize profiles. Very few measure real output.

## Solution

CREDEX evaluates professional credibility using only real proof:
- Projects built
- Problems solved
- Contributions made
- Consistency over time

It generates a Credex Score (0–1000) along with:
- A detailed skill gap analysis
- A build focused improvement roadmap
- A proof based resume
- An auto generated portfolio

No claims. Only evidence.
